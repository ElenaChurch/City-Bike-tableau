##City Bike Tableau

The goal of this tableau story is to show how the impact of a coronavirus affected city bike usage. Two years were compared, 2019 and 2020. 3 factors were looked at to see if they had changed from one years to the next. Age, gender, and end station popularity were compared between the two years. 

There are 3 different dashboards in this tableau story.

The first dash board is looking at the number of rides per age and compares that between 2019 and 2020. There are 2 charts here showing the relationship between age and rider frequency. There is a line chart and a bubble chart.
The second dash board is looking at how the gender of the rides changed from 2019 to 2020. First there is a line chart that counts the number of rides per gender per birth year for each year. Then there is a  bar chart that compares the gender of rides between 2019 and 2020.

The last dash board has 2 maps that display the popularity of each of the end stations. The top map shows station popularity for the years 2019 and the bottom maps shows station popularity for 2020.
