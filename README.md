City Bike Tableau


 The purpose of this project was to see how over the course of 2 years how CityBike usage changed in the state of New York. A map was created of all the end bike stations and each of the stations is color coded to see how often that station was used in a specific year. Then the relationship between gender and bike usages was looked at for both years and displayed in a graph. Age was another factor that was looked. A bubble chat was great and a line graph was used to display the trends in age.
